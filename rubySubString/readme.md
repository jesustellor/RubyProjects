The main ruby file is commented so that it can be read easily by others.

When you first run ruby main.rb, you will be prompted to enter a word to search for. it is not necessary to type the word in quotes.
next you will be asked for the file to search in this case i have set up a file called hello.txt, you can change the extension, i have only tried rb and txt. but you will have to type the file extension.. no quotes..

it should return a match for the word in the file.
